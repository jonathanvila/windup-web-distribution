Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) ${project.version} is an extensible and customizable rule-based tool that helps simplify migration of Java applications.

MTA examines application artifacts, including project source directories and applications archives,
then produces an HTML report highlighting areas that need changes.

MTA can be used to migrate Java applications from previous versions of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
or from other containers, such as Oracle WebLogic Server or IBM WebSphere Application Server.


How Does MTA Simplify Migration?
-------------------------------------
    MTA looks for common resources and highlights technologies and known “trouble spots” when migrating applications.
    The goal is to provide a high level view into the technologies used by the application and provide a detailed report organizations can use to estimate,
    document, and migrate enterprise applications to Java EE and JBoss EAP.


Run MTA
---------------
    Open a terminal and navigate to the MTA_HOME directory.

    Run MTA against the application using the appropriate command.

        For Linux:

        $ MTA_HOME/run_mta.sh

        For Windows:

        > MTA_HOME/run_mta.bat
